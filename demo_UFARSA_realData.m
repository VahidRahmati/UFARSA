% The script "demo_UFARSA_realData.m" applies UFARSA to the "sample_data.mat" file containing a number of fluorescence
% traces (i.e. time-courses), which can be assumed to be extracted from different region of interests (ROIs). Simply run 
% this script and see UFARSA's spiking activity reconstruction results for these traces.
% This script can be adapted to apply UFARSA to new recorded fluorescence traces. The main blocks to be adapted by 
% user are those corresponding to setting the data directory, and the central reconstruction parameter; i.e. blocks 1
% and 3. The other lines in this script mainly provide the options for deciding on the steps of UFARSA. 
% For the rest of parameters as well as the saving and plotting options please open the "internal_parameters.m"
% file (in Matlab), and adjust it as you desired. Please also read the "user_guide.pdf" file for more details. 
% Hint: If this is the first time to execute this script, please be sure that you had already run the "steup_UFARSA.m" file.

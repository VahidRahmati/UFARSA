# UFARSA
This repository contains the Matlab codes implementing the UFARSA (Ultra-fast Accurate Reconstruction of Spiking Activity). UFARSA is a novel, heuristic model-free-type method which enables an ultra-fast, accurate, near-automatic reconstruction of spiking activities from noisy calcium imaging data. UFARSA has been introduced in this paper: 

“**Ultra-Fast Accurate Reconstruction of Spiking Activity from Calcium Imaging Data**”; Vahid Rahmati, Knut Kirmse, Knut Holthoff, Stefan J. Kiebel (2018), Journal of Neurophysiology: https://doi.org/10.1152/jn.00934.2017

You can readily setup and then apply UFARSA to your recorded fluorescence traces (time-courses); please see the **User_Guide.pdf** and the two **demo scripts** in this repository.

Hint: The current verison of UFARSA has been tested on Matlab 2018.

### Files history:
User_Guide.pdf updated: in particular, by adding a hint on the scaled firing rate vectors (see "Useful hints" section).
reconstruction_UFARSA.m updated: Some Matlab, different version's incompability issues were resolved.
